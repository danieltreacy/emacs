Daniel's Emacs config
==============

Pretty ain't she.

Structure
-------

* Packages managed by Marmalade and ELPA (via
  https://tromey.com/elpa/).
* Prelude Packages to ensure that my Emacs is up to date, regardless
  of which machine I'm using.
* Primarily geared towards Ruby, Scala, and Java development.

Tips, tricks and tomfoolery sourced from many places, most significantly:
